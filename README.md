# Keep-it-cool
Presented at NASA International Spaceapps 2019

## Climate impact visualizer
Keep it cool is visualization tool that maps NASA's GISTEMP data on a WebGL based globe, and displays the impact of climate change over the past century.<br/>
Red/orange spikes = higher global mean temperature (anomalies)<br/>
Blue/purple spikes = lower global mean temperature (anomalies)

## Global temperatures predictor 
We implemented a regression model that can tell the global temperature at any time in the future, given the CO2 emissions. It provides an interactive feedback for the user to play around with and see what the effects of CO2 emissions in the future years, could mean for the global mean temperatures.
